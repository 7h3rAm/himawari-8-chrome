# Himawari 8 New Tab Page

Experience the latest image taken by the [geostationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit) [Himawari 8 satellite](http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/) every time you open a new tab in Chrome. The satellite has been deployed by the [Japan Meteorological Agency](http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html) and takes photographs of Earth every 10 minutes. Since the new tab page is a simple web page, you can also [try it online](https://domoritz.github.io/himawari-8-chrome).

ðŸ›° Get the extension from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/himawari-8-new-tab-page/llelgapflianaapmnpncgakfjhfhnojm).

## Features

* Caches last version in local storage (compressed jpeg) and immediately displays it when you load the page. Then loads the latest image.
* JSON proxy on AppEngine to get around same origin policy. The code is on the [proxy branch](https://github.com/domoritz/himawari-8-chrome/tree/proxy).
* Full offline support
* Images are drawn on a canvas so that we can cache and load it easily.
* Switch between visible light and infrared images from [Himawari 8](http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/) and images from the EPIC camera on the or [DSCOVR](http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/) satellite (only in the extension).
